# ObjectsLab
Introduction to creating programs with stateful objects and methods.

In this lab, we are learning how programs are built with objects that work together and create an interface for other objects. 

There are two partially complete programs in the starter code: a habit tracker and a golf program. Imagine that you have been hired as a programmer to complete the data model of these two programs. The objects that you create will be used as the core part of these applications.

## Directions
- Complete all of the TODO items left as comments in the code
  - Some instructions are written as English sentences that you will need to translate into the correct Java syntax.
- Test the applications thorougly to check for bugs
- Add your own features
